Image host for minecraft resource packs which are used on the Hypixel skyblock wiki. Resourcepacks belong to their authors, and are not owned by the skyblock wiki

# Updating assets in packs
If only modifying an existing asset or adding new one, the most recent version of a modpack may be used - however if assets are being moved / renamed, please create a new version of the modpack (inside the modpack's main folder) so that assets on the wiki don't start to 404. This is needed not only so that the wiki has time to update, but encase someone is stuck with a cache css file using the old texture pack locations. However, old version of the modpack can be cleared once this is not longer a concern in a day or two after the changes go live on the wiki.

Also note that 3D models are not automatically rendered from their texture; any images must be stored how the end user should see them.
